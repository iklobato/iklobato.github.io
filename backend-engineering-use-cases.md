    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>Following OneTrust's acquisition of Convercent, I was tasked with creating a mission-critical data migration platform to transfer terabytes of sensitive compliance data across different database schemas while maintaining strict data integrity and privacy requirements.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I designed and implemented an enterprise-grade ETL pipeline with Django APIs handling complex schema transformations across 50+ data types. I built flexible mapping engines to accommodate customer-specific data structures and implemented parallel batch processing to optimize performance.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>At SecurityScorecard, non-technical users struggled to interact with complex security data, limiting the platform's accessibility and adoption.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I built a Langchain-powered chatbot with FastAPI that provided a natural language interface to the security data. The system included context-aware query processing and maintained user session state for follow-up questions.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>While at Dextra Digital, I worked with Globo.com to develop APIs that could handle extreme traffic spikes during major media events, with requirements to process 500K+ requests per hour without performance degradation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I architected a distributed API system using Flask and Django that implemented advanced caching strategies, connection pooling, and asynchronous processing for compute-intensive operations. I designed the system with horizontal scalability in mind, allowing for dynamic resource allocation during peak events.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>At IKTech, I worked on PayPal/Venmo's financial transaction systems, where enhancing authentication security was critical while maintaining seamless user experience across millions of daily transfers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I created Python validation decorators that prevented common attack vectors by implementing multi-layered verification checks. I developed comprehensive QA testing frameworks covering 20+ edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities. The authentication system incorporated device fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, and progressive security challenges based on risk assessment.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>At Dextra Digital, Caixa needed to validate that their new real-time banking platform could handle extreme concurrent connection loads without performance degradation or connection failures.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I designed and implemented a WebSocket stress test suite capable of simulating 130K concurrent connections. The testing framework included realistic user behavior patterns, variable connection/disconnection rates, and detailed performance metrics collection to identify bottlenecks.</p>
