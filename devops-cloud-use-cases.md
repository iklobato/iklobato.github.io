    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>I was tasked with migrating a legacy PHP system to AWS serverless infrastructure while improving performance and reducing operational costs.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I architected and implemented a serverless solution using AWS Lambda, S3, and API Gateway, replacing traditional server-based deployment. I optimized Lambda functions for cold starts and implemented a tiered caching strategy to reduce database load.</p>

        <div class="impact">
            <p>The migration achieved an 85% performance improvement, 99.9% uptime for critical APIs, and a 40% reduction in hosting costs. The CI/CD pipelines I built reduced deployment time by 70%, allowing for more frequent and reliable updates.</p>

<div class="use-case">
    <h2 class="use-case-title"><i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> Cloud Migration and Cost Reduction for ProbiusDx at IKTech</h2>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>ProbiusDx, a bioinformatics startup, was facing excessive cloud costs and performance issues with their medical diagnostic data analysis platform on Azure.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I led a complete cloud migration from Azure to AWS, redesigning the architecture to leverage appropriate instance types and implementing auto-scaling based on actual usage patterns. I built microservices with proper containerization and orchestration for the compute-intensive analysis workflows.</p>
        
        <div class="tools">
            <span class="tool">AWS</span>
            <span class="tool">Docker</span>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Business Impact</div>
        <div class="impact">
            <p>The migration reduced cloud infrastructure costs by 40% while simultaneously improving platform reliability to 99.9% uptime. The redesigned architecture handled 100K+ daily API requests with sub-second response times for real-time analysis, critical for medical diagnostic applications.</p>

<div class="use-case">
    <h2 class="use-case-title"><i class="fas fa-cubes"></i> Microservices Architecture for SecurityScorecard</h2>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>SecurityScorecard needed to scale their cybersecurity rating platform to handle rapidly growing data collection requirements and API traffic, but their monolithic architecture was creating deployment bottlenecks and scalability issues.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I implemented a microservices architecture handling 1M+ hourly API requests with 99.95% uptime. I designed service boundaries based on business domains, created resilient ingestion pipelines across heterogeneous data sources, and implemented a comprehensive versioning strategy for APIs to ensure smooth transitions for clients.</p>

            <span class="tool">Docker</span>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Business Impact</div>
        <div class="impact">
            <p>The new architecture enabled SecurityScorecard to scale their platform to handle 3x more vendors per customer, directly supporting business growth. API usage increased by 30% as external partners found it easier to integrate with the platform. The independent deployment capabilities reduced release cycles from weeks to days.</p>

<div class="use-case">
    <h2 class="use-case-title"><i class="fas fa-dharmachakra"></i> Kubernetes-based Client Tools for OneTrust</h2>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>After designing OneTrust's data migration platform, we needed secure deployment options that could work in various client environments, including air-gapped networks with strict security policies.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I designed Kubernetes-based client tools with containerized components that could be deployed in diverse environments. I implemented encryption for data in transit and at rest, created infrastructure-as-code templates to standardize deployments, and built in comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.</p>
        
        <div class="tools">
            <span class="tool">Kubernetes</span>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Business Impact</div>
        <div class="impact">
            <p>The flexible deployment architecture allowed OneTrust to successfully migrate 20+ enterprise clients, including those with the most stringent security requirements. The containerized approach reduced deployment time from days to hours, accelerating project timelines and improving client satisfaction during the migration process.</p>

<div class="use-case">
    <h2 class="use-case-title"><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> CI/CD Pipeline Optimization for Data Processing</h2>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Challenge</div>
        <p>Across multiple roles, I observed that data engineers were spending excessive time on deployment processes, with inconsistent environments causing hard-to-debug issues between development and production.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">Technical Solution</div>
        <p>I built comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins that automated testing, validation, and deployment of data processing code. I implemented infrastructure-as-code practices using Terraform to ensure environment consistency and created parameterized deployment templates that data engineers could easily configure.</p>

        <div class="impact">
            <p>These improvements reduced deployment time by 70% and virtually eliminated environment-related bugs. Data engineering teams could focus on data quality and processing logic rather than deployment mechanics, resulting in faster feature delivery and more reliable data pipelines across the organization.</p>
